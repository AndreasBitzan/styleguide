           <h1>Naming Conventions</h1>
           <p>We decided to use <a href="http://getbem.com/">BEM</a> as our class naming convention as it is the easiest to read and make edits to.
            Perfect to be used with Sass.</p>
            <p>We used kebab-case for our class names and our file names.</p>
            <p>BEM specifies that we do our styling with classes and subclasses that relate to each other. A class in this case would be known as a block,
                and a subclass would be known as an element of that block. A block is named like you would normally name it, but an element name starts out
                with the block name then we add a __(element name). For example, "menu-item" would be the block and "menu-item__photo" would edit an element for
                menu-item called "__photo".
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    .menu-item {
                        display: flex;
                        height: 175px;
                        width: 550px;
                    
                        &__photo {
                            position: relative;
                    
                            height: 175px;
                            width: 175px;
                        }
                    }
